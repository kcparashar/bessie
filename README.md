## What is this?
[CalTime](caltimeprod.berkeley.edu) is an unfortunately complicated system to enter your hourly log as a UC Berkeley employee. To help alleviate this cognitive annoyance, this script is a way to automate logging in and out. Feel free to contribute and port to your liking. Raise an [issue](https://github.com/kcparashar/bessie/issues/new) and I'll try to get back to you ask quick as I can!

### Automatic Hours with `cron` (Optional)
If you prefer to save your self the hassle of running this script, you can choose to automate it with `cron` a UNIX utliity that lets you run background task on schedule. 

This is best paired with a server, for which I recommend [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/3ad22fa86c99) (referral link with $10 credit). 

To use `cron` you must first open a *crontab*. [Corenominal](https://corenominal.org/2016/05/12/howto-setup-a-crontab-file/) provides a useful guide. 

Then enter in the options from below or write a custom entry. 

#### 40 Hour Work Week
`cron 00 09,17 * * 1-5 node bessie.js`

#### 30 Hour Work Week
`cron 00 09,15 * * 1-5 node bessie.js`

#### 20 Hour Work Week
`cron 00 09,13 * * 1-5 node bessie.js`

#### 10 Hour Work Week
`cron 00 09,11 * * 1-5 node bessie.js`
