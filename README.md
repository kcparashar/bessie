### Automatic Hours with `cron`
If you prefer to save your self the hassle of running this script, you can choose to automate it with `cron` a ____ that lets you run background task on schedule. 

This is best paired with a server, for which I recommend [DigitalOcean](https://m.do.co/c/3ad22fa86c99) (referral link with $10 credit). 

To use `cron` you must first open a *crontab* with ___. 

Then enter in the options from below or make your own custom one with _. 


#### 40 Hour Work Week
`cron 00 09,17 * * 1-5 node bessie.js`

#### 20 Hour Work Week
`cron 00 09,13 * * 1-5 node bessie.js`


Thatâ€™s it! Enjoy your automatic hours entry.
